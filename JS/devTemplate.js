Users can report an emergency request or an empty dispensary. A notification is then sent to local users encouragaging them to donate sanitary wear to the reported bin. The app leverages the use of existing infrastructure i.e. sanitary bins located around universities.",

"The web application, DocuVault was built in Blazor. Initially I had struggled a lot working with Blazor as I had limited experience as both an app developer and a web developer. Most of my development experience had come from my game design courses. However, I found that through multitudes of on-going iterations my skills have improved quite drastically over the past two to three months I have been working on this project. I also realised that it was much easier to fine tune smaller issues when I had built the entire page and was just going back and refining the details."];
